This web-based application allows users to write, compile, and execute code in C, C++, and Python and generates verdicts based on test cases upon code submission. It includes features for authentication and authorization, user dashboards, profile updates, and management of problems and test cases. The platform is deployed on AWS, and version control through Git.
The project available at https://www.codifystudio.live is currently down due to AWS charges.
